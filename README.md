Weather App created for Free Code Camp challenge

https://jamespeilow.github.io/weather-app/

Created a simple app to fetch weather data using a variety of location search methods.

Users can search for location using their device's geolocation API, get an approximate location with an IP address search, or can search a location using a text input.
The text input uses the Google Geocoding API to get the weather for the closest location match to what the user has entered. 

Users can click on the temperatures to toggle between Celcius and Farenheight.

The card's color scheme changes based on the weather conditions, and icons update based on the weather. 

The weather icons used are from the <a href="http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/">Climacons</a> website, and designed by <a href="twitter.com/#!/adamwhitcroft">@adamwhitcroft</a>.
